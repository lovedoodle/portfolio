      When starting the redesign of the Analytics dashboard, I was told to do the layout using CSS Flexbox. I had never used that before and I was nervous. After reading Angular Material's documentation and some experimentation I was able to get a handle on it. It was my first time "learning on the job". I found the supportive office environment and the encouragement from my co workers lead to me learning something much faster than when I was home studying alone.

      Other colleagues of mine did the actual analytic calculations and I worked with them to incorporate the design and functionality of the javascript frontend with the ruby backend. It was quite an experience and one I would love to experience all the time!
